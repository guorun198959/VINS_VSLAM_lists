## VINS Algorithms

### Loosely coupled (LC)
Advantages:
+

### Tightly coupled (TC)
Advantages:
+ No scale ambiguity problem when using the monocular camera;
+ More systematic uncertainty propagation with easier measurement uncertainty determination than that of pose uncertainty in LC;
+ More accurate results


#### Monocular
(1) MSCKF and variants

(2) 

#### Stereo 
(1) Trifocal tensor
